Here are some ideas to make your pulse jet simulation app more futuristic and engaging:

Advanced Visuals

Add animated holographic overlays, particle effects, and glowing trails.
Use 3D engine visualization (WebGL/Three.js) for interactive rotation and zoom.
Simulate shockwaves, heat distortion, and exhaust turbulence.
Sound & Audio

Add spatial audio (panning, Doppler effect) as the engine moves.
Let users mix in environmental sounds (wind, city, sci-fi ambience).
Control & Feedback

Add AI assistant or voice control for changing parameters.
Real-time telemetry dashboard with graphs and historical data.
Interactive diagnostics: show engine wear, valve failures, or overheating.
Customization

Let users design their own engine geometry and see the effects.
Add futuristic engine modes (plasma, hybrid, antimatter pulse).
Simulation Scenarios

Mission modes: simulate takeoff, cruise, attack, or emergency shutdown.
Add multiplayer or shared simulation for collaborative experiments.
Augmented Reality

Use AR to project the engine into the user’s environment (with WebXR).
Education & Storytelling

Include historical context, blueprints, and interactive lessons.
Add a “future timeline” mode showing speculative pulse jet tech.
